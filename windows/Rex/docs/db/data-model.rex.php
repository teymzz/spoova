                        Models are structures built to have a direct relationship with database. Hence,
                        they are capable of performing database queries. Spoova handles database communications based 
                        on standard relationships and user session id. Database relationships are handles based on 
                        <span class="c-olive">one to one</span>, <span class="c-olive">one to many</span> or 
                        <span class="c-olive">many to many</span> relationships. Spoova however, uses specifically designed basic methods 
                        to communicate directly with database.

                                This <code>delete()</code> method takes a single parameter which can either be a bool of true or an integer limit of number of data to be deleted. The limit may not

                                this method will not delete any data. It is also advised to to keep the live server off if this method will be applied.

                                The <code>ofUser()</code> method is used to pull a data of the current user session account. 
                                The database default structure format demands that any table owned by the current user must have a 
                                <code>user_id</code> foreign key column that is mapped to the id field on the user's table. When data 
                                are obtained using models, <code>ofUser()</code> makes it possible to pull only data related to the current user.
                                For example: If a database table <code>"user"</code> contains an id (primary key) column, then a table (comments) must have a field 
                                name with <code>user_id</code>. The user_id is then used to pull data from the <code>comments</code> table which belongs
                                to the current session user.

                                In Example above, a post model was extended to the Models class with the table name "Posts". 
                                When data is pulled from this class, it uses the "Posts" database table. If the <code>ofUser()</code> 
                                static method is applied on "Posts" (i.e <code>Posts::ofUser()</code> ), then spoova will try to find 
                                the <span>Posts</span> related to the current user id by looking for a <code>user_id</code> field in the 
                                <code>Posts</code> table. By default, this method uses the current user id to pull data, however, this can be modified.
                                The <code>ofUser()</code> method takes its first argument as an integer. This integer is the id of the user 
                                whose data must be pulled from the database. For example:

                                In Example above, a post model was used to obtain data of the current user or a custom user just by setting the 
                                user id. This is by far the easiest way to pull data from database without writing any query. Spoova will run its 
                                queries internally to pull respective data from the database then store it using the current model name. It should 
                                be noted that the <code>read()</code> method is used to read data from the database while the <code>->Posts</code>
                                is the current Model name which stores the data obtained as a traversable object. When an error occurs, the last error 
                                is saved and can be obtained using the <code>read()->DBError</code> property. In the event that the foreignKey field name is 
                                not user_id, then a second argument can be supplied into the <code>ofUser()</code> method to define a new key name, In this 
                                relationship, the user database table (i.e user) will be the owner while the Model (e.g Posts) table is being owned. We don't need to set the 
                                user table since that has been done in the <code>icore/init</code> file during installation.

                                The <code>of()</code> method is similar to the <code>ofUser()</code> method. In this method, the table name can be 
                                customized if the relationship is between a model and any other database table. The first argument 
                                takes a new database table name while other arguments follows the ForeignId and ForeignKey structure respectively. By default, 
                                if the owner database table for example is <code>"admin"</code>, then a owned table <code>"posts"</code> must have an "admin_id" foreign key field 
                                while the owner table must have an "id" local key field which helps spoova 
                                to naturally connect the two fields. For example:

                                In the Example above, the posts database table will look for posts where admin_id is 3. It should be noted that 
                                the "admin_id" foreign key is generated from the combination of the singular form of the owner table along with an 
                                "id" local key by default. This means that for example, if the owner table was "admin" or "admins", then the default 
                                generated foreign key will be "admin_id". This is done by stripping off the last "s" character of the field name. This means 
                                that for a string with double "ss" last characters, one will be removed while the other will remain.

                                            "C" table is the link table or bridge between "A" and "B".

                                            then table "C" is a parent table while table "B" is a grand table.

                                    In order to set up this connection, the table "A" must have 
                                    a Foreign key field name "C_id" (modifiable) relative to its direct parent "C" and the table "C" must have a Foreign key name "B_id" (non-modifiable) relative to its 
                                    direct parent "B". Once the connection is successfully chained, we can proceed to obtain our data through the use of the current model's property which must be initialized 
                                    with a capital letter case. The code below is an example of this connection.

                                comment table will look within itself for where post_id foreign key is equivalent to posts table local key "id" 3. 
                                then the posts table will bind to its own parent "users" through the parent foreign key field name "user_id". 
                                This relationship can thus be defined as a complex relationship, one that is defined for a Child, Parent and GrandParent.

                        Database relationships have three main structures which are: 
                        <span class="c-dodger-blue">one to one</span>,
                        <span class="c-dodger-blue">one to many</span> and
                        <span class="c-dodger-blue">many to many</span> relationships. Spoova model uses static methods to link and 
                        obtain database information under these three defined relationships. When working with relationships, data obtained 
                        can be accessed through a small letter case property unlike the default with uses an uppercase inital case. The 
                        <code>vdump()</code> helper function might serve a good purpose to view the type of data returned.

                                In this relationship, a child model class method is placed as a method upon its Parent Model. The type of relationship is then defined. Once the relationship 
                                is defined, then we can call the method. It is important to note that the child method must be a static method.

                                    method is a directive that tells the Model to obtain the defined relationship data between a model and 
                                    its respective child models. Also, unlike the <code>of()</code> and <code>ofUser()</code> methods that use 
                                    the Model's name as a property to obtain data, when accessing data under any of the known predefined relationships, 
                                    the first parameter of any relationship is used to obtain the collected data. For example, the <code>admin</code> 
                                    property was used to access the data because the first argument of <code>matchOne()</code> is the <code>Admin::class</code>. 
                                    In situations where the foreign key is not "user_id", we can supply the foreign key as the second parameter.

The above data simulates a structure or format for setting up a one to one relationship between two database tables. By default, 
spoova uses the model name of classes as the default database table name. This behaviour can be overidden by setting the model's table 
name using the <code>tableName()</code> method which can be applied for any model. For example in the code below, the "PostItems" model will 
assume that the database table name is <code>post</code>  rather than <code>postitems</code> because the default behaviour was changed. <br><br>

                                        method is placed on its Parent Model. Within the child Model, the "matchMany" relationship is defined.

                                In a similar manner like "one-to-one" and "one-to-many" relationship, the <code>matchedFor</code> sets an inverse relationship for these two relationship 
                                (i.e matchOne and matchMany). In this case, the current model where this relationship is defined assumes that it is being owned by a parent model.  
                                This relationship can be defined by placing a Parent model class method on its Child Model. Within the Child Model, the "matchedFor" relationship will be defined 
                                This means that the first parameter of the <code>matchedFor</code> must be a parent model. Once the relationship is defined, then we can call the method.

                                This relationship is more advanced than the "one-to-one" and "one-to-many" database relations. 
                                This can be best explained with a situation in which a user can have many roles while many roles can 
                                also be assigned to multiple users. Using a database structure between a user and role tables, a third 
                                table "role_user" which is generated through alpabetic conjuction of role and table, we have a sample

                                In the code sample structure above, the <code>users</code> and <code>roles</code> table both have a binding 
                                relationship through a third table <code>role_user</code> which by default contains fields generated by the 
                                singular form of its source tables along with a default "id" local key specific to both parent fields. Both the 
                                singular form and the default local key are separated by and underscore "_". It is important to note that the 
                                singular form of any table is genarated by stripping off the last "s" character of that table name. This means that 
                                while a singular form of <code>users</code> will be <code>user</code>, the singular form of <code>user</code> will 
                                also be <code>user</code>. Using the table structure above, we can set up our relationship as shown below:

                                    table. If the linking table is not <code>user_role</code> which is the default, then we can supply the custom table name as the second argument. 
                                    Also, in this relationship, the parent tables <code>users</code> and <code>roles</code> must have an "id" primary key. However, the foreign keys can be 
                                    modified. The supplied model's custom foreignkey and the current model's foreign key on the linking table can be supplied as the third and fourth argument 
                                    respectively. Hence we can have a format as below:

                                The <code>read()</code> method is a directive that tells a model to process the relationship defined 
                                in a way that the relative data is returned. For example, we can select unambiguos fields easily by 
                                declaring the array list of fields we want to obtain as the first parameter of the <code>read</code> 
                                method just as shown below:

                                the limit of data obtained by setting the limit as a second parameter.

                            These methods can only be applied before the <code>read()</code> method is called. Once the data is obtained through the 
                            <code>read()</code> method, then we can apply other methods which are <code>error()</code>, <code>pull()</code>, <code>protect()</code>

                                The example above gives an insight into how the <code>where()</code> method can be applied on models or relationships. This method enables 
                                us to be able to set certain conditions which our data must meet before it can be successfully obtained. The 
                                <code>where()</code> method takes the first argument as a raw string that defines a list of fields and their respective values (or binded parameter placeholders). 
                                If the binded parameter sign (i.e "?") is used, then a second parameter that matches the number of expected binded values must be supplied 
                                on the <code>where()</code> method.

                                The <code>use</code> method enables us to customize table names or even fetch a table that was overidden. The code sample is

                                    the <code class="c-brown-ll">pull()</code> method allows us to pull data out of a list of collections 
                                    using the defined data access key. For example, the code above will pull out the first data obtained from a multidimentional

                                    Once an access key is protected, the value becomes <span class="c-brown-ll">***Protected***</span>. 
                                    The code above is an example local scope protection.  
                                    Data collections can also be protected at a global level. This means 
                                    that all models will remember to hide the value of some specific fields. 
                                    This can be done by calling the <code class="c-brown-ll">Collection::protect()</code> method.

                array (size=0)
                empty
            private 'iterator' => int 0
            private 'callables' =>

                                    In the above, if we try to use the <code>get()</code> method directly to fetch an index, it may trigger an error.
                                    Instead, we can first optimize the object before finally chaining the <code>get()</code> method on it just as below:
                                </div>  

                                <div class="pre-area shadow">
                                    <pre class="pre-code">
  var_dump( Optimize(Roles::user()->user)->get(0, ['firstname','lastname']) );
                                    </pre>
                                </div>
                                
                                <div class="foot-note mvs-10">
                                    The collection data above was optimized before calling the <code>get()</code> method. Since no data index "0"
                                    exists, the optimizer will ensure that the <code>get()</code> method returns a false value by default. In case we  
                                    want to obtain the list of array we supplied (i.e firstname and lastname), we can set the Optimizer mode as false. This 
                                    will ensure that if array is supplied as sub indexes, then each of the array supplied will become an index assigned the <code>false</code> value. 
                                    An example is shown below: 
                                </div>  

                                <div class="pre-area shadow">
                                    <pre class="pre-code">
  var_dump( Optimize(Roles::user()->user, false)->get(0, ['firstname','lastname']) );

  <span class="no-select comment">//Rather than return <span class="c-red">false</span>, the above returns:</span>

  <span class="c-orange-dd">array (size=2)</span>

    'firstname' => boolean false
    'lastname' => boolean false

                            The errors encountered by any relationship is usually being stored in the <code>error</code> property but can be obtained 
                            through the <code>error()</code> method. The "error" method can be placed upon the dynamic collection properties or 
                            directly on the <code>read()</code> method. A sample format is below:
                        </div>
                        <div class="pre-area shadow">

   User::posts()->read()->error(); <span class="no-select comment">//valid</span>

                            Any of the method above is valid to obtain error. If no error occurs, then the <code>error()</code> method will return a false 
                            value.
