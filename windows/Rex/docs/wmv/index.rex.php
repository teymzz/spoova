                            The WMV pattern is an achitecture built upon the ideology of MVC pattern.
                            It follows a series of predefined structures that makes up the WMV itself. This system 
                            can be entirely classified into six categories which are <code>Routes</code>, <code>Frames</code>, 
                            <code>Models</code>, <code>APIs</code>, <code>Sessions</code> and <code>Rex</code> files, where the <code>Rex</code> files are template files 
                            controlled mostly with template directives and compiled using compiler functions.

                            The WMV depends on a structure where a <code>Model</code> is created before a 
                            <code>View</code> is rendered. In order to work with wmv framework, 
                            a window file must be created. Window files are classes that are extended to a root Window manager class.
                            Hence, they inherit properties of the Window parent which has url management, request access and template 
                            loading features.

                                The windows folder is a reserved directory storing for Routes, APIs, Frames, Models, Sessions and Rex files. By order of standard, spoova employs 
                                a standard logic which uses different window files as route entry points. These file are added to the 
                                windows route directory (i.e <code>windows/Routes</code> )  and each window file extends to a 
                                root <code>Window</code> class which is the main controller.

                                <div class="">
                                    Logics are structures designed for resolving how route urls are processed through the use of controller files. In WVM architecture, 
                                    web urls are divided into three subdivisions (i.e window, base and path) which are usually resolved by a controller file which determine how routes are loaded. In order to effectively manage routes and  
                                    to allow for flexibilites, WVM employs the use of either a single super controller file (window) or multiple super controller files which are categorized into logics to manage routes.
                                    By default, whenever a page is loaded, the url is transferred to the windows management structure. This will try to resolve the url by looking for 
                                    a super controller route file within the <code>windows/Routes</code> directory and under the <code>spoova\mi\windows\Routes</code> namespace. If 
                                    a window entry class file matching a url's entry name does not exist, spoova will return a 404 error. The window logics are of 3 categories:

                                        The basic logic involves the use of a super controller file to handle routes. Under this logic, whenever a url is visited, the route management structure transfers the url to a specified super controller 
                                        file which determines how the url is resolved. In order to use this method, the <code>index.php</code> file's <code>Server::run()</code> 
                                        method should be supplied with a class name as argument e.g <code>"basic"</code> just as below. 
                                        <br>
                                        <div class="pre-area shadow mvs-10">
 <div class="pxv-10 bc-silver">index.php</div>

                                        Once this is done, then the application will assume that a <code>windows/Routes/Basic.php</code> file controls the entire application. The namespace is generated from the supplied 
                                        super controller's file name (i.e basic). If the file (i.e class) exists within the predefined path, then the class will take the full ownership and control of how urls run. This means that 
                                        every url will first land on that <code>windows/Routes/Basic.php</code> file which will then determine how such url is handled. In this manner, 
                                        the Basic file is the sole distributor and manager of all urls. Without it, pages will not be able to load.

                                        Index logic is built upon the basic logic. In this logic, the <code class="calibri">windows/Routes/Index.php</code>
                                        file takes the full ownership and control of how urls are handled. When an index page 
                                        (e.g <code class="calibri">http://host_name/</code> or <code class="calibri">http://host_name/index</code>) is visited, index class will resolve 
                                        the index page by calling its <code class="calibri">root()</code> method. However when other urls whose entry names are not index are called, 
                                        then spoova will try to resolve the urls by looking for a file with the root name within the <code class="calibri">windows/Routes</code> directory.
                                        If the file does not exist, then spoova will return a 404 error page. The structure below is an example of how to set up an index logic.

                                                In the code above, by setting the <code>index.php</code> file to 
                                                <code>Server::run('index')</code>, the application will try to call the <code>windows\Routes\Index.php</code>. 
                                                If the file exists and the currently requested url is an index page, the <code>windows\Routes\Index.php</code>file will in turn call its <code>root()</code> method 
                                                using the shutter method <code>call()</code>.
                                                However, if a different url is called whose entry point name is not "index", rather than call the <code>root()</code> method, 
                                                spoova will check if the route file exists first within the <code class="calibri">windows\Routes</code> directory and try to use the class to 
                                                resolve the url. The <code>self::callRoute()</code> method ensures that 
                                                the window tries to load every page using a class entry window name that exists within the <code class="calibri">windows\Routes</code> directory. If the url handler or window router file 
                                                does not exist, then a 404 reponse is returned through the <code>self::close()</code> method.

                                                In any given url, an entry name returned by <code>window('root')</code> or <code>window(':')</code> 
                                                is always the name that comes after the domain url. In localhost, it is the name that comes after the project folder name. In the code 
                                                above, assuming the project folder name is <code>app</code>, then a url "http://localhost/app/" and "http://localhost/app/index" will run successfully because the 
                                                <code>call()</code> method was used and both urls still refer to the index page. In situations where we need to handle more paths on the index page, for example 
                                                "http://localhost/app/localhost/more_path" then <code>self::basecall()</code> may be preferred instead while noting that unwanted urls must be filtered out through some validation logic.

                                        Unlike other logics, standard logic suggests that all urls must have a window entry point corresponsing to a server entry file that takes ownership of its 
                                        relative sub-urls. When a url is visited, standard logic will split the url into divisions to obtain an entry point name. The entry point name of that url must have a correspoing 
                                        controller class that determines how the url is loaded. This means that a url <code>http://localhost/home</code> and <code>http://localhost/home/user/...</code> for example, will be handled 
                                        by a root window file <code>"Home"</code>. This <code>Home</code> window class within the <code class="calibri">windows/Routes</code>
                                        directory will determine how its relative sub-paths are resolved. If the root window file does not exist, then a 404 error page is returned. 
                                        In any given url there is always a window or entry point as explained <a href="@route('::about_wmv')"><span class="c-olive hyperlink">here</span></a>. In order to define a standard logic, 
                                        the <code>Server::run()</code> code in root config file <code>index.php</code> must have no arguments.

                                         page is visited, then a 404 error will be returned. Once a method is defined, developer is left 
                                         to handle how to close such urls. Any of a window's method can use the shutter methods. It is important to note that 
                                         shutter methods are specifically built for standard logic.

                                    Usually, under standard logic, main controller files can be easily guessed from url structure since it is the url's main entry point. 
                                    In order to protect main controller file names, a map file <code>.map</code> must be created within the <code>window/Routes</code> directory. This map file 
                                    is expected to contain a json syntax for mapping url window to their corresponding class names. In this manner, window files becomes difficult to guess. An example of this 
                                    is shown below: <br><br>

                                    </div>
                                </div>

                                    Using the sample above as reference, under a standard logic when a url is visited, for example <code>http://localhost/home/user</code>, the <code>windows/Routes/Home</code> class 
                                    is expected to be called but due to the <code>.map</code> file, the <code>windows/Routes/HomeController</code> will be called instead. This same approach will be used for 
                                    the profile. This makes it possible to protect the main controller file names. We can also define a prefix name for all protected routes. This means that the prefix will be added before 
                                    calling the route names. This makes it easier to fake route entry names. Example is shown below:
                                </div> <br>

                                    <div class="pre-area">

                                       When map file is used as above, the default behaviour of route file names will be changed. All route files will now be assumed to have a suffix of "App". For example, rather 
                                       than looking for a <code>Home</code> route file for <code>http://localhost/domain/home</code>, instead, the route file that will be looked for is <code>AppHome</code>. This makes it difficult 
                                        for anyone to guess the route entry file name.

                                    Inverse is the way to reduce the strict level of standard logic. By default, the standard login assumes that 
                                    window roots are have controller files within the <code>windows/Routes</code> directory and that the file name 
                                    starts with an uppercase character while other characters are in lower case. This make it important that when a root <code>"docs/"</code> 
                                    is accessed, then the route <code>Docs</code> is called. However, if the root "doCs" is called instead, this will fail because the 
                                    route file "doCs" or "DoCs" does not exist but what we have is <code>"Docs"</code>. In other to remove the default strictness behaviour to 
                                    ensure that window roots accepts any lower case character, we need to add a non-strict level directive into the map file. This 
                                    can be seen in the example below <br><br>

                                    will now be called due to the <code>.map</code> file's directive to resolve that root in a non-strict type. Without the map file, only a url <code>http://localhost/docs/user</code> 
                                    will be able to call the route file "Docs". Note that once the inverse operator <code>"!"</code> is used before the key (e.g "!Docs"), the case of the key does not matter, however, the 
                                    case of the value must be maintained as the expected main route file name.

                            Frames are used to bind window files together. They store and provide similar data shared across window files. 
                            Although, Frames are extensions of Window class itself, they act as bridges or gaps between the root Window class 
                            and a Window child class. When a class is extended to a frame class, it inherits both the properties of the root window class
                            along with the specific frame class. The purpose of frame is to separate windows files that have different data from each other.
                            All window files sharing the same Frame will have data belonging to their specific frames.
