                            The call methods are methods designed to manage window urls. Every url path called on a 
                            window can be handled using specially designed method which are listed below 
                            
                            <br><br>

                            All urls introduced into any Window file, can be streamlined into acceptable and 
                            invalid urls. This is done by using any of the call methods above. When any of the call methods 
                            listed above are applied, they are given certain acceptable urls to deal with. The syntax of these call methods is 
                            shown below: <br><br>

                                                passing the argument mostly as an array. Note that the position of the argument can also serve as close only if the argument is a boolean and a fourth argment

                            Whenever a url is called on a shutter 
                            and that url does not exist in the list of accepted urls by 
                            such window shutter, that shutter will automatically close resulting in a 404 error page. When any of the shutter methods above is used, 
                            a subsequent shutter method cannot follow. For example, 
                            if <code>call()</code> method is called, then one cannot apply any other method (e.g <code>root()</code>) below it. 
                            This is because the shutter system method by default is configured to handle one shutter method at a time by any window method. 
                            This means that once a shutter method is called, all other shutters are disabled from functioning because once a url does not exist, 
                            a 404 error page has to be returned. In order to keep a window open when a shutter is applied, a pending directive must be applied on the specific call type
                            which tells the shutter method to prevent automatic closing of the windows. This option may be employed when handling complex applications or urls. 
                            This can be done by setting a third or fourth argument as a boolean value of <code>false</code>.
                            Whenever any of the shutters are pended, developer must be careful to properly close invalid urls, most especially for <code>basecall()</code> because 
                            failure to close may result in faulty or black pages if not properly handled.

                                <div class="c-orange font-em-1">The Window Function</div>
                                Before we continue, lets take a look at the <code>window()</code> function. 
                                This function is specially designed to return specific divisions of any url. Every request url is divided into 3 divisions. These divisions are:
                                <br><br>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><span class="c-olive">root</span> : the current url's window entry point name</li>
                                    <li><span class="c-olive">path</span> : the path that directly follows the window's entry point name</li>
                                    <li><span class="c-olive">base</span> : this returns the entire url (i.e root + path)</li>
                                </ul>

                                The samples below reveals the different sections of a url based on the three paths mentioned above.

                                        The above examples reveals that the chosen root (or window) is usually the path after a 
                                        project folder name or the path after a site's domain name.
                                    </div>
                                </div> <br>
                                
                                <div class=" mvt-6">
                                    Since we now understand that the domain part of our url can be <code>localhost/folder</code> or 
                                    <code>site.com</code>, in tutorial course, we will use the name "domain" to refer to this part 
                                    of url.
                                </div> <br>

                                The <code>window()</code> takes any of the arguments "base", "path" or "root". Whenever any of these three 
                                arguments are supplied, using the current request url, the window function returns the 
                                equivalent value of that argument supplied. This is shown below: <br> <br>
                                
<div class="pre-area shadow">
    <div class="pxv-10 bc-silver-d">Example (Page url): http://domain/user/abc/... </div>

                                    In the above, the root, path and base options returns their equivalent part of the url. The ellipes is used to denote more paths. Although, <code>window(':')</code> is a short form of 
                                    <code>window("root")</code> There are special uses of this reserved option. The colon is a directive that append root directory to urls supplied urls. When the colon 
                                    character precedes any argument, the window function understands that such arguments are relative paths which must be appended to url. For example, using the previous 
                                    request url: 
                                </div> <br>

                                can be replaced by <code>base:</code> or <code>path:</code> but when only the colon <code>:</code> precedes the argument, then the <code>root:</code> is automatically assumed as revealed in

                                    The root path approach suggests that the current window url has an entry point that exists within 
                                    the lists of supplied valid entry points. If the entry point exists, then the corresponding method 
                                    supplied for it will be triggered. If the entry point does not exist within the valid lists, then a 404 
                                    error page is displayed. An example is displayed below.

                                    will only match the url's window entry point "home". Since our root class name is "home", this means that using

                                    The <code>root()</code> method is only realistic for use in window root server files. This is because the 
                                    <code>rootcall()</code> only works on the root entry point. As long as a urls root name is matched, the <code>rootcall()</code> 
                                    method will not bother to check the relative paths on that particular request url. The figure below best explain this behavior.

                                    In the above, we can see that as long as <code>home</code> is the root entry point, the window url 
                                    will become a valid url. It is important to remember that domain for localhost is usally the <code>localhost/project_folder_name</code>
                                    
                                    As an example, if a basic logic is employed, this means that all urls will be handled by a base window server class. This class 
                                    is expected to be directly within the <code>windows/Routes</code> directory. Assuming the server class name is Index, then
                                    the Index class may be configured to use the <code>rootcall()</code> method to initialize other classes based on the url's 
                                    window name, since it is the class that manages every other url. In this way, rather than use methods, we can 
                                    directly call classes using the format below:

                                    In the code above, the <code>win:</code> directive tells the window class to load its value as a class.
                                    When a url, for example <code>http://domain/home</code> or <code>http://domain/home/any/path</code> is visited, 
                                    the class <code>spoova\mi\windows\Routes\Home</code> will be triggered. The <code>profile</code> also works in a similar way. 
                                    However, when a page e.g <code>http://domain</code>, <code>http://domain/index</code> or <code>http://domain/index/any/path</code> 
                                    is visited, the <code>root()</code> method is triggered. Remember that if the index page is visited, then <code>window(':')</code> 
                                    will also return the name <span class="c-brown-ll">"index"</span>. This means that we can replace our first array key of <code>'index' => 'root'</code> 
                                    with <code>window(':') => 'root'</code> and our class will still run perfectly.

                                    The window's path is the path that follows a window (entry point) in any window url. The <code>window('path')</code> 
                                    function returns the path of the current request url. By using the <code>Window::pathcall()</code> method, this acts 
                                    directly on a list of path that follow the current window (or page) url. The <code>pathcall()</code> method does not 
                                    care about the window entry point name. Instead, it only deals with the path supplied on the window name by making sure that the path supplied 
                                    exists in the list of acceptable url paths. If the current request url of a page has its path in the list acceptable urls paths,
                                    <code>pathcall</code> will trigger the corresponding method, else a 404 error page is returned.

                                            This is essential because the <code>call()</code> requires the direct full path

                                    The <code>basecall()</code> method works similarly as the <code>call()</code> method on the direct path 
                                    supplied. However, the difference is that a basecall method is applied on urls that must have a specific 
                                    parent path structure. For example, a url of <code>home/users</code> and <code>home/users/profile</code> both have the 
                                    same parent path of <code>home/users</code>. Hence, the <code>basecall</code> will be triggered for both urls
                                    mentioned earlier if the url supplied was <code>home/users</code>. The dangers of this method is that it can leave 
                                    unwanted urls opened. When working with urls, it is important to be precise. This makes the handling of urls to be less 
                                    ambiguous. This method could however prove useful in certain cases when we are trying to call a different class or trying to 
                                    accept any path on a specific window url. When it is used anyway, developers must make sure that 
                                    all non-essential urls are properly closed or handled properly.

                                Since shutters control how url are managed and they also help to automatically close invalid urls, by default, when any shutter method is used, another subsequent one cannot be used within the same window method. 

                                For example, if we previously use a <code>call()</code>
                                method, then we cannot use, <code>rootcall()</code>, <code>pathcall()</code>, <code>basecall()</code> or even <code>call()</code> itself after. 
                                This idea is generated from the fact that two different urls (or files) should not be loaded (or resolved) in a single url. Naturally, if any shutter cannot resolve its list of acceptable urls, it will automatically 
                                close unless pended. However complications may arise when we need to resolve multiple urls or resolve urls differently. 
                                Shutters can be pended by supplying a third parameter of <code>false</code> to any shutter method used. When this is done, 
                                a shutter will only allow a subsequent shutter to run if it was unable to resolve any of its urls.

                                    In the code above, the <code>call()</code> was pended to allow the <code>basecall()</code> to also run. 
                                    If a url is resolved by <code>call()</code>, then <code>basecall()</code> will trip off. However,
                                    if a url is not resolved by the <code>call()</code> method, then the <code>basecall</code> will try to resolve its own 
                                    list of urls. If <code>basecall()</code> cannot resolve its urls, then, a 404 error page is displayed and a false value is returned. 
                                    Also, if the <code>call()</code> was able to resolve its url, we can force <code>basecall()</code> to work by declaring the previous <code>call()</code> 
                                    as unresolved. This can be done by adding the <code>$this->resolved(false)</code> immediately below the <code>call()</code> 
                                    method. Another method to force our <code>basecall()</code> to work is to call it within the <code>self::clearResolved()</code> method which takes a closure as callback argument.
                                    These are shown below: <br>

                                    The code structure above is a good example of how to check if a url is resolved. If the <code>call()</code> cannot resolve its urls, 
                                    then since it was pended,  this will allow <code>basecall</code> to try to resolve its own urls. If basecall happens to resolve it urls, 
                                    since it is a soft shutter, it will leave the resolved url opened to allow multiple paths unless it is handled properly. Naturally, we don't 
                                    want to close a url with <code>self::close()</code> when it is resolved because that will send a 404 response to server. However, the <code>self::close()</code> method above 
                                    is just a way to show that a url can be closed using 
                                    the <code>self::close()</code> method.

                                    to harvest the last resolved url. Rather than use <code>window(':user')</code>, we can use the <code>lastCall()</code> 
                                    function which will naturally return the last resolved call. If any argument is supplied on it (e.g <code>lastCall('/path')</code>)
                                    then <code>home/user/path</code> will be returned.
